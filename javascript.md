## Toolchain
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) "At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. 
When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles."

Can be incorporate into webpack bundler - [babel-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/#root)
